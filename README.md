# Overthinkr 🎯

## Basic Details

### Project Description
Overthinkr is an AI-powered web application that analyzes short text messages to decode hidden emotional tone, subtext, and generational slang. Built using React (Vite) and deployed with Vercel serverless functions, the application securely integrates the Gemini API through a backend route to ensure API key protection. It provides a tone score, contextual explanation, and intelligent reply suggestions (Confident, Calm, and Witty) to help users better understand and respond to ambiguous digital conversations.

### The Problem statement
In modern digital communication, short and ambiguous text messages often create confusion, misunderstandings, and overthinking. Tone, slang, punctuation, and response patterns (like dry texting or being left on read) can carry hidden emotional meaning that is difficult to interpret accurately.

### The Solution
Overthinkr is an AI-powered web application that analyzes text messages to detect emotional tone, tension level, and hidden subtext. It provides a clear explanation along with smart reply suggestions, helping users respond confidently and reduce miscommunication in digital conversations.
